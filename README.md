# notex_test.entity
This is my work in progress custom Hitman 3 map that I am creating as a learning experience.

## Layout:
```
ðŸ“¦notex_test.entity
 â”£ ðŸ“‚chunk1patch2
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚TBLU
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ002358C35FE1FD13.TBLU.JSON (Data - Entity Blueprint)
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ002358C35FE1FD13.TBLU.meta (Dependencies)
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚TEMP
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œ00E63B961C72ADFF.TEMP.JSON (Data - Entity Template)
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ00E63B961C72ADFF.TEMP.meta (Dependencies)
 ```

## Basic summary of the files
### Entity Blueprint
Contains the structure of map including entities and their names and a vast range of other things.

### Entity Template
Contains properties and data for every entity.

## Concerns
AI might not be possible currently due to the lack of tools to compile a navmesh (But this might change in the future).
