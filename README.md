## Instructions for use
### Downloading required tools:
1. Download simple-mod-framework from [https://github.com/hitman-resources/simple-mod-framework](https://github.com/hitman-resources/simple-mod-framework).

### Deploying the map:
1. Clone this repo into the `Mods` folder of simple-mod-framework.
2. Add `HM3CustomMaps` into simple-mod-framework's config.json in the `loadOrder` section 
2. Run `Deploy.exe`.

### Launching the map:
1. Copy the files from simple-mod-framework's `Output` folder into your game's `Runtime` folder (Excluding thumbs.dat).
2. For now the only way to play any of these custom maps is by editing the `SCENE_FILE=` line in thumbs.dat (You can use [https://notex.app/tools/online/xtea/](https://notex.app/tools/online/xtea/) to do that).
3. Launch the game, it should now boot directly into the custom map of your choice.
